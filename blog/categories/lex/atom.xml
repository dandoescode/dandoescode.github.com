    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lex 2.2 has just been released.  Not much has changed, but a Minor version bump was required due to a backwards-incompatibility issue.</p>

<h4>Changelog</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a test which was PHP 5.4 only.</li>
<li>Added PHPUnit as a composer dev requirement.</li>
<li>Added a Lex\ParsingException class which is thrown when a parsing exception occurs.</li>
</ul>


<p>The 3rd point is the one that caused the version bump.  Before it would simply dump a message and then <code>exit()</code> (that was stupid).</p>

<h3>New Home</h3>

<p>Lex has been moved from the Fuel GitHub organization to the PyroCMS organization (<a href="">https://github.com/pyrocms/lex</a>).  This was done because it was originally built for PyroCMS and it will be maintained by myself and the Pyro team.</p>

<p>With this change I have also re-named the Composer package to <code>pyrocms/lex</code>, so please update your composer.json files. If you try using the old one, it should tell you that it is replaced by the new one and to update your requirement.</p>

<p>As always if you run into issues go ahead and let me know via the Issue Tracker.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After 4 months of no progress or changes to the Lex Parser, I decided it was time for a face lift.  Although there arenâ€™t many new features in 2.0, the things that have changed are big.</p>

<h4>Changelog</h4>

<ul>
<li>PHP version requirement has been upped to 5.3</li>
<li>All code is now PSR-0, 1 and 2 compliant. (See here for more information on the standards.)</li>
<li>Lex is now a Composer Package (under the name fuel/lex).</li>
<li>The Lex GitHub repository has been moved under the fuelphp organization.</li>
<li>New  and  conditional tags have been added.</li>
</ul>


<p>To learn how to install and use Lex using Composer, read the README.</p>

<p>As I stated in the changelog, the repository has been moved under the PyroCMS organization on GitHub.  The URL is <a href="">https://github.com/pyrocms/lex</a>.  This was done to centralize the code, as well as give it a broader audience to help come up with new features and spot bugs faster.</p>
