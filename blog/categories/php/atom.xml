    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After 4 months of no progress or changes to the Lex Parser, I decided it was time for a face lift.  Although there arenâ€™t many new features in 2.0, the things that have changed are big.</p>

<h4>Changelog</h4>

<ul>
<li>PHP version requirement has been upped to 5.3</li>
<li>All code is now PSR-0, 1 and 2 compliant. (See here for more information on the standards.)</li>
<li>Lex is now a Composer Package (under the name fuel/lex).</li>
<li>The Lex GitHub repository has been moved under the fuelphp organization.</li>
<li>New  and  conditional tags have been added.</li>
</ul>


<p>To learn how to install and use Lex using Composer, read the README.</p>

<p>As I stated in the changelog, the repository has been moved under the PyroCMS organization on GitHub.  The URL is <a href="">https://github.com/pyrocms/lex</a>.  This was done to centralize the code, as well as give it a broader audience to help come up with new features and spot bugs faster.</p>
