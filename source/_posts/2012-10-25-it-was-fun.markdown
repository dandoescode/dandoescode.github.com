Many of you will have already known this was coming eventually.  For the past 8 months or so I have been contributing to FuelPHP less and less (in-fact nothing anytime recently).  Today, I am officially stepping away from the project.

Harro ([@WanWizard](http://twitter.com/WanWizard)) is, and has been, the project lead. I have full confidence in his abilities to take the project further than I ever could.  I will be transfering everything (domain name, DNS, hosting accounts, etc) over to him over the next few days, so no worries about any of that.

This decision has nothing to do with the framework itself. I still believe it is, and will be, a great solution for a lot of people.

It was fun while it lasted, I just have to move on.
