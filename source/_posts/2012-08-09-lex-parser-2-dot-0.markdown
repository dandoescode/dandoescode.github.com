After 4 months of no progress or changes to the Lex Parser, I decided it was time for a face lift.  Although there arenâ€™t many new features in 2.0, the things that have changed are big.

####Changelog

- PHP version requirement has been upped to 5.3
- All code is now PSR-0, 1 and 2 compliant. (See here for more information on the standards.)
- Lex is now a Composer Package (under the name fuel/lex).
- The Lex GitHub repository has been moved under the fuelphp organization.
- New {{ unless }} and {{ elseunless }} conditional tags have been added.

To learn how to install and use Lex using Composer, read the README.

As I stated in the changelog, the repository has been moved under the PyroCMS organization on GitHub.  The URL is [https://github.com/pyrocms/lex]().  This was done to centralize the code, as well as give it a broader audience to help come up with new features and spot bugs faster.
