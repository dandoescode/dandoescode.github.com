With 2013 coming up I have decided to do an overhaul of my online presence.  This includes usernames/"handles", as well as the content
I put out there.  I decided to do this for a two main reasons:

1. I was bored with how things were.
2. I felt I was not representing myself the way I wanted.

My online usernames have always been "dhorrigan" (well, since I have been over the age of 14 or so anyway).  This is great, and I originally
did it so that I would look "more professional" and be "taken more seriously".  Recently I have decided that my actions and words should
portray those things...not my username.  So with this thought in mind, I have changed (mostly) all of my usernames to **DanDoesCode**.  It
is a bit more fun and I like it better.  I have also changed my URL to [dandoescode.com](http://dandoescode.com) and my Email to
[me@dandoescode.com](mailto:me@dandoescode.com).

I have always said what I thought, and that will not change.  However, I will be doing it with a little more "tact" (I hate that word).  I
will do my best to refrain from calling people idiots, or just being negative in general.  In the past, I have generally only tweeted about
negative points about things.  This has lead people to think that I am really negative, which I try not to be.  I need to be pointing out
the good in things as well, and not just spit out a bunch of hate torwards a certain project/subject.
